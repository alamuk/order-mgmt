Implementing NGRX - State Management with Angular

We create some Actions, LOAD_ORDERS, LOAD_ORDERS_FAIL, LOAD_ORDERS_SUCCESS that we will dispatch with NGRX EFFECTS

We can use them in the Reducer

Initial State originally is hardcoded, and we composed few selectors to get the data in the component.
