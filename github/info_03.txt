In an existing angular-cli project that was set up with the default css styles you will need to do a few things:

Change the default style extension to scss
Manually change in .angular-cli.json or run:

ng set defaults.styleExt scss

Rename your existing .css files to .scss (i.e. styles.css and app/app.component.css)

Point the CLI to find styles.scss

Manually change the file extensions in apps[0].styles in .angular-cli.json

Point the components to find your new style files
Change the styleUrls in your components to match your new file names
